As a frontend developer (Student), my goal for this Capstone Project is to design and implement a Quiz App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The application will allow users to take quizzes on various topics, display questions one by one, and show the final score at the end.

I will using the Open Trivia Database API to fetch quiz questions and display them in a structured format.
